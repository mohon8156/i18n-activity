Instructions: 

This follows the process at https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/review-instructions.html

1. **CREATE A PROPOSED REVIEW COMMENT BY REPLACING THE PROMPTS ABOVE THIS PARAGRAPH, BUT LEAVE THIS PARAGRAPH INTACT AS WELL AS THE TEXT BELOW IT** Then ask the i18n WG to review your comment.

2. Set a label to identify the spec. This starts with **s: followed by the spec's short name**. If you are unable to do that, ask a W3C staff contact to help.

3. After discussion with the i18n WG, **raise this issue to the WG that owns the spec**. Use the text above this para as the starting pint for that comment, but add any suggestions from the i18n WG.

4. **Replace the text 'url_for_the_issue_raised**' below with a link to the place you raised the issue. Do NOT remove the initial '§ '. Do NOT use []() notation - just paste the URL.

5. **Remove the 'pending' label.** DO NOT add a needs-resolution or tracker tag to this issue – add it to the issue you raised in the other WG's repo.

6. Edit this issue to **remove all the instructions** down to and including this line,  but no further.




**This is a tracker issue.** Only discuss things here if they are i18n WG internal meta-discussions about the issue. **Contribute to the actual discussion at the following link:**
